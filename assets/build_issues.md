# Build Issues Documentation

## Current Issue
- Build process terminates during production build (Error 143)
- Occurs during execution of `build-no-warnings.js`
- Build command: `node build-no-warnings.js`

## Probable Causes
1. Memory constraints during build process
2. Process timeout
3. Resource limitations

## Recommended Solutions

### Immediate Solutions
1. Increase Node.js memory limit:
   ```bash
   export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"
   ```

2. Optimize build configuration:
   - Implement chunking for large modules
   - Enable code splitting
   - Optimize asset imports

### Long-term Solutions
1. Review and optimize large dependencies
2. Implement progressive loading strategies
3. Consider implementing dynamic imports for large modules

## Build Process Recommendations
1. Use production build flags:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm run build
   ```
2. Clear cache before building:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```
