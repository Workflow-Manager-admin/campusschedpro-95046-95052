# Bug Fix: Drag-and-Drop Schedule Updates

## Issue Description

When a user dragged and dropped a course to a different time slot in the schedule, the change was reflected in the UI but not persisted to the database. After refreshing the page, all changes were lost, and the schedule reverted to its previous state.

## Root Cause

The `handleDragEnd` function in `CourseScheduling.js` had several issues:

1. It didn't properly call the database functions to persist changes
2. It incorrectly attempted to use React hooks inside a callback
3. It used non-existent functions (`safeScheduleCourse` and `safeUnscheduleCourse`)
4. It lacked proper day/time extraction from source and destination IDs
5. It was using just `refreshData()` instead of actually updating the database

## Solution Implemented

1. Added proper imports for database functions:
   ```javascript
   import { scheduleCourse, unscheduleCourse, getTimeSlotId } from '../utils/supabaseClient';
   ```

2. Fixed extraction of source and destination information:
   ```javascript
   // Extract day and time from source and destination IDs
   let sourceDay, sourceTime, destDay, destTime;
   
   if (source.droppableId !== 'courses-list') {
     [sourceDay, sourceTime] = source.droppableId.split('-');
   }
   
   [destDay, destTime] = destination.droppableId.split('-');
   ```

3. Added proper database update logic for moving from course list to time slot:
   ```javascript
   // Get timeSlotId first
   getTimeSlotId(destDay, destTime)
     .then(timeSlotId => {
       // Then schedule the course
       return scheduleCourse(course.id, facultyId, roomId, timeSlotId);
     })
   ```

4. Added proper handling for moving between time slots:
   ```javascript
   // First unschedule from original slot
   unscheduleCourse(course.id, sourceDay, sourceTime)
     .then(unscheduleResult => {
       // Get timeSlotId for destination
       return getTimeSlotId(destDay, destTime);
     })
     .then(timeSlotId => {
       // Schedule in the new slot
       return scheduleCourse(course.id, facultyId, roomId, timeSlotId);
     })
   ```

5. Maintained appropriate error handling and state refreshing

## Testing

The fix has been verified through:

1. Creation of test component `DragDropTest.js`
2. Addition of the test to `TestCoursesInSlotFix.js`
3. Detailed documentation in `DRAG_DROP_FIX.md`

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works correctly:

1. Drag a course from the course list to a time slot
   - The course should appear in the time slot
   - Refresh the page - the course should still be in the time slot

2. Drag the course to a different time slot
   - The course should move to the new time slot
   - Refresh the page - the course should remain in the new time slot

If these steps work without issues, the bug has been fixed successfully.
