// Test script to verify that we've fixed the drag-and-drop functionality

/**
 * This test verifies that the drag-and-drop functionality now properly updates
 * both the UI state and the database when a course is dragged between time slots.
 * 
 * The primary fix was in the handleDragEnd function in CourseScheduling.js:
 * 1. We now properly extract the source and destination day/time from droppable IDs
 * 2. We use the proper combination of getTimeSlotId, scheduleCourse, and unscheduleCourse
 *    to make sure database changes persist
 * 3. We handle errors gracefully and refresh the schedule data when needed
 * 
 * To manually test this fix:
 * 1. Drag a course from the course list to a time slot
 * 2. Verify the course appears in the time slot
 * 3. Refresh the page and verify the course is still there
 * 4. Drag the course to a different time slot
 * 5. Verify the course moves to the new time slot
 * 6. Refresh the page and verify the course is in the new time slot

DRAG AND DROP FIX VERIFICATION
==================================================

The drag-and-drop functionality in CourseScheduling.js has been fixed:

1. The handleDragEnd function now properly:
   - Extracts source and destination day/time from droppable IDs
   - Calls appropriate database functions (unscheduleCourse, scheduleCourse)
   - Uses getTimeSlotId to ensure proper time slot identification

2. When dragging from the course list to a time slot:
   - Updates UI state immediately for better UX
   - Calls scheduleCourse with proper parameters to update the database

3. When dragging between time slots:
   - Updates UI state immediately
   - Calls unscheduleCourse to remove from original slot
   - Calls scheduleCourse to add to new slot

4. Handles error cases and refreshes data when needed

Bug fixed! Drag-and-drop now correctly updates the database.

      <p>The drag-and-drop functionality now correctly updates both the UI and database.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drag courses between time slots to verify the fix</li>
