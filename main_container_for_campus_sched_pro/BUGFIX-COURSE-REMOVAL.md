# Bug Fix: Entity Removal UI Update

## Problem Description

When users deleted courses, faculty, or rooms from the application, the entities would still appear in the UI until the user manually refreshed the page. This created a confusing user experience where deleted items would still appear to be available.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the issue was that while the entities were being successfully deleted from the database through API calls, the local state management wasn't being updated immediately. Instead, the application was relying on a separate data refresh operation to update the UI, which only happened on certain events like page reload.

## Solution Implemented

The following changes have been made to ensure that when entities are deleted, they immediately disappear from the UI:

### 1. FacultyManagement Component
- Updated `handleDeleteFaculty` function to immediately filter out the deleted faculty member from the local state using `setFaculty` after a successful deletion
- Added logic to clear the selected faculty if the deleted faculty was currently selected

### 2. RoomManagement Component
- Updated `handleDeleteRoom` function to immediately filter out the deleted room from the local state using `setRooms` after a successful deletion
- Added cleanup logic to clear related UI states like selected room and modal dialogs

### 3. CourseScheduling Component
- Updated `handleDeleteCourse` function to immediately:
  - Filter out the deleted course from the courses list using `setCourses`
  - Remove the course from any schedule slots it appeared in by updating the `schedule` state
  - Clear selected course state and close dialogs

### 4. ScheduleContext
- Enhanced the `deleteCourseById` method to:
  - Immediately update the courses state
  - Remove the deleted course from any schedule slots
  - Remove related conflicts from the conflicts list
- Enhanced the `deleteRoomById` method to:
  - Immediately update the rooms state
  - Remove room allocations for the deleted room
  - Clear room assignments for any courses that were using the deleted room

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users now see immediate feedback when they delete an entity
2. **Reduced Confusion**: No "phantom" entities remain in the UI after deletion
3. **Fewer Required Refreshes**: Users no longer need to refresh the page to see accurate data
4. **Consistency**: The UI state now accurately reflects the database state at all times

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Add a new faculty member, then delete it - it should immediately disappear from the list
2. Add a new room, then delete it - it should immediately disappear from the room list
3. Add a new course, schedule it in the timetable, then delete it - it should immediately disappear from both the course list and any schedule slots it was placed in

All these operations should now work without requiring a manual refresh of the page.
