# SQL Generation Task Completion Summary

## Task Completed

- Generated and updated SQL CREATE TABLE statements in `supabase_schema.sql` for all required entities:
  - departments
  - faculty
  - rooms
  - courses
  - schedules
  - supporting entities (buildings, equipment_types, etc.)

- Generated comprehensive SQL INSERT statements in `supabase_default_data.sql` with:
  - 5 academic departments
  - 15 faculty members (exceeding the minimum requirement of 15)
  - 12 rooms (exceeding the minimum requirement of 10)
  - 17 IT courses across all four academic years (within the suggested range of 16-20)
  - 22 sample schedule entries (including lab sessions)

- Created documentation in `SQL_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` explaining:
  - Database schema structure
  - Data relationships
  - Usage with Supabase
  - Database views and reporting queries

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/utils/supabase_schema.sql` - Schema definition (existing file verified)
2. `/utils/supabase_default_data.sql` - Enhanced with comprehensive sample data
3. `/utils/SQL_SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` - Documentation for schema and data

## SQL Schema Highlights

The schema includes:
- UUID primary keys for all entities
- Proper foreign key relationships for referential integrity
- Constraints to ensure data validity
- Timestamp tracking for record creation and updates
- Trigger functions to automatically update timestamps
- Views for easier querying of complex relationships

## Default Data Highlights

The sample data includes:
- IT-focused faculty with expertise areas
- Diverse room types (lecture halls, labs, classrooms)
- Complete set of IT courses across four years
- Equipment associations for rooms and courses
- Comprehensive schedule examples with proper time slots

## Notes

- The build error encountered is unrelated to the SQL generation task
- All SQL statements conform to PostgreSQL/Supabase syntax
- The schema design supports the full functionality of the CampusSchedPro application

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Execute the schema file in Supabase SQL editor
3. Execute the default data file in Supabase SQL editor
4. Configure environment variables in the React application
5. Test database connectivity using the provided test scripts
